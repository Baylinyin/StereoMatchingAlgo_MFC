# StereoMatchingAlgo_MFC
Implementation of stereo matching algorithms using C++/MFC in Visual Studio: Census, Dynamic Programming (DP), GraphCuts (OpenCV), and SAD
- Census and DP were implemented in collaboration with Computer Vision Lab, Seoul National University.
- GraphCuts (OpenCV) was totally from OpenCV (I only made an interface from my code to connect to this).

These codes were used in my papers:
